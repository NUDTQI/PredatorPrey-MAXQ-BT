/** An action with a duration different than one has to be treated with SemiMarkov-Learning rules in all
the learning algorithms, since otherwise the result can be far from optimal. Many Learning-Algorithm in the this package support
Semi-Markov Learning updates.
This action class maintains its own action data object, a CMultiStepActionData object. This data object stores the duration it has needed by now and the finished flag. The duration and the finished flag get normally set by an HierarchicalController, but it is also possible to set the duration for example in the environment model, if you have a primitive action which takes longer than other primitive actions. In that case your model-specific action has to be derivated from CPrimitiveAction and CMultiStepAction.
\par
The class also contains the method isFinished(CStateCollection *state). This method is used (normally by a hierarchical controller) to determine
wether the action has finished or not. The controller sets the finished flag according to isFinished, so other Listeners only have to
look at this flag. This method must be implemented by all (non-abstract) sub-classes.
